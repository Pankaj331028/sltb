RE: ACCOUNT NUMBER 373549000 
Hello IVIS J. PACHECO, 
Upon signing your credit agreement, you agreed to repay your account in monthly installments.

After many failed attempts to collect the payment due on the account indicated below, the Lender is exercising this right. This is the FINAL DEMAND for payment. Failure to resolve the delinquency on the account identified below, within 30 days from the date of this letter, will result in the account defaulting.
